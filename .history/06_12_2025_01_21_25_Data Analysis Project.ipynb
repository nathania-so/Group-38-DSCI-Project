    "To investigate which player characteristics are predictive of subscribing to game-related newsletters, we selected age and total play hours as our key variables. Our analysis follows a complete data-science workflow, from cleaning the data to preparing it for modeling. Below, we describe the steps we used to process and wrangle the data before analysis. We will use a K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) classification model to predict whether a player subscribes to the newsletter. Our response variable (y) is the subscription status, and our predictors (x) are age and played hours.\n",
    "KNN is chosen because the outcome is a binary categorical variable and the relationship between age, played hours, and subscription is unlikely to be perfectly linear. Unlike linear regression, which requires a continuous outcome and strong assumptions about linearity, KNN is a flexible non-parametric method that can capture more complex patterns. Since KNN relies on distance calculations, we will standardize age and average hours played so that both variables contribute equally to the model."

    "This classification model was designed to predict whether a player will subscribe to a game based newspaper based on their age and hours played. Five-fold cross validation with 18 nearest neighbours in the K-nearest neighbours model provided the best performance on training data, so it was chosen for the final model. From the visualizations above comparing the predicted and true subscription status, it is clear that there are some statuses predicted incorrectly, suggesting that age and hours played may not be the best predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model had 71.4% accuracy when assessing the test data with a precision of 73.9%, and a recall of 94.4%. This indicates that the model does not frequently miss detecting potential subscribers (high recall), but also has a notable number of false positives (in this case predicting a player will subscribe when they will not, leading to moderate precision). Because the model mislabelled many non-subscribers as subscribers, the overall accuracy was lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results indicate that while age and played hours provided some insight into whether players will subscribe to the newsletter or not, the metrics suggest that these predictors alone cannot reliable identify subscribers from non-subscribers. Subscription status is likely influenced by a combination of additional variables rather than strictly age and hours played."

    "This lines up initial expectations. The exploratory visualizations (**Figures 1**, **2** and **3**) showed some level of correlation between age, hours played and subscription status, but none that immediately stood out as strong. It was expected that a certain level of predictive accuracy could be found by using these variables, but since no trends were especially clear in the explorations, it is doubtful that accuracy would be particularly high.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Figure 1**, it was noticed that all players with aged 16 and under were subscribed to the newsletter. This indicated that there might have been some sort of trend there, but since the vast majority of players were 17 years of age or older, one could not be fully confident that the apparent trend would result to much. Something similar with **Figure 2** was noticed. All players with over 10 hours played were subscribed to the newsletter, but almost all players had played under 10 hours. **Figure 3** was a combination of the two previous visualizations, and thus preserved the trends noticed before, but also didn't offer many new insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "This led to middling expectations about the efficiency of the model, which were reflected in reality once the data was analyzed and predictions made."

    "Given that age and hours played alone did not produce strong predictive power, several future directions emerge. First, additional predictors could be incorporated to capture behavioural or motivational factors that age and play time cannot explain. For instance, player experience level may better reflect familiarity with the platform and the likelihood of engaging with newsletters. Other potentially important variables include gender, session frequency, or social activity indicators (e.g., number of friends, participation in events), which may be more directly tied to engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future work could also explore different combinations of predictors or interactions among variables, as subscription behaviour is likely influenced by multiple factors simultaneously rather than single features in isolation. Finally, evaluating alternative modelling approaches such as logistic regression or tree-based models may help uncover non-linear patterns that KNN cannot capture. These directions would help determine which features or model structures more effectively distinguish subscribers from non-subscribers."
